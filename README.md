# SQL agent LLM

A SQL agent to help you with your database. It can help you to write SQL queries, understand the data, and search in easily.

## Overview

Technically, it is a group chat with multiple LLM agents: a product manager, a SQL developer, and a quality analyst. All are working together to help you with your SQL request.

### Features

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a proof of concept. It is not intended to be used in production. This demonstrates how can LLM can be used to iteratively enhance and critique its own work.

- [x] Access the system with a web browser
- [x] Include notes explaining how to use the generated queries
- [x] Query is enhanced internally by the LLM agents
- [ ] Infrastructure as code for deployment on a cloud
- [ ] Stateless architecture
- [ ] Connect to a remote database
- [ ] Use with a SSO (Single Sign-On) system

## Local installation

### Prerequisites

```dotenv
# .env
AOAI_API_KEY=xxx
AOAI_BASE_URL=https://xxx.openai.azure.com
AOAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=xxx
AOAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=xxx
AOAI_LLM_DEPLOYMENT=xxx
```

```bash
make install
```

### Run

```bash
make dev
```

## Behavior

Multiple personas are involved in the conversation to handle the project accomplishment:

- **chat_manager**: The main agent that manages the conversation and assigns tasks to other agents.
- **developer**: Writes SQL queries based on the requirements.
- **product_manager**: Responsible for scoping the project and defining the objectives.
- **quality_analyst**: Reviews the SQL queries for accuracy and efficiency.

All the team work until the virtual backlog (managed by the product manager) is completed.

### Example

User query is *Which 3 brands should I advertise the most? Based on sales and popularity*.

SELECT b.brand_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price) AS total_sales
FROM brands b
JOIN products p ON b.brand_id = p.brand_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id

\`\`\`
What changed:
- Wrote a SQL query to calculate the total sales for each brand by joining the `brands`, `products`, and `order_items` tables. The total sales are calculated by multiplying the quantity of items sold by their list price for each brand, then summing these amounts. The results are grouped by brand name and ordered in descending order of total sales.

Task 3 is validated. The SQL query accurately calculates the total sales for each brand and is efficient in execution. The results are grouped by brand name and ordered in descending order of total sales, correctly identifying the sales figures for each brand.

JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id

\`\`\`
What changed:
- Created a SQL query to calculate the popularity score for each brand by counting the distinct number of customers who have ordered products from each brand. This involves joining the `brands`, `products`, `order_items`, and `orders` tables. The results are grouped by brand name and ordered in descending order of popularity score.

\`\`\`
What changed:
- Combined the sales and popularity data to rank brands by creating two Common Table Expressions (CTEs), `SalesData` and `PopularityData`, for total sales and popularity scores respectively. Then, joined these CTEs on `brand_name` to combine the data. The final result is ordered by total sales in descending order, and in case of a tie, by popularity score in descending order. Limited the output to the top 3 brands.

Task 5 is validated. The SQL query efficiently combines sales and popularity data to accurately rank brands. By using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for total sales and popularity scores and then joining these CTEs, the query effectively identifies the top 3 brands based on total sales and, in case of a tie, on popularity score. The final result is correctly ordered by total sales in descending order, and by popularity score in descending order where necessary, with the output limited to the top 3 brands.
